Next steps to complete the MVP:
Implement NetBox API integration – push Device + Interfaces to NetBox

Add vendor detection – use SysObjectID to identify Sophos/Cisco/HPE/etc.

Handle configuration – read targets from YAML config file + credentials

Docker Compose – wrap collector + optional NetBox instance together

Duplex/port information – add more interface attributes (if-mib extended)

Which would you like to tackle first?

A) Finish NetBox API client (create devices/interfaces in NetBox)

B) Add YAML config file support (to avoid CLI flags)

C) Add vendor detection & vendor-specific MIBs (Sophos, Cisco, etc.)

D) Something else?
